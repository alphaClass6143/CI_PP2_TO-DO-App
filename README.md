### Design Choices

The website is designed as a Single Page Application. It is a full width layout and focused on giving the user all they information they need.  
Modals are put into place for Creating/Editing a task or for changing user settings.  

### Colors

The website is mainly white with black text but the accent color is a custom color.  
The colors can changed in the user settings. The following colors are available:

### Fonts

The Inter font from Google Fonts was chosen for its visual clarity. It is easily readable and friendly to the eye. The second font is sans-serif if the font is not loading.

### Structure

The structure is very simple. It is a Single Page Application with modals that pop up if user input is required.
The top of the page allows the user to access the user settings and create new tasks.
The main page is structured in the task list and task overview.

#### Task list

The task list shows the list of tasks categorised in active and done tasks. Clicking one task will show it in the overview.
Tasks can be marked as done on the left with the checkcircle.  

#### Task overview

The task overview shows the details of the current selected task, such as: Title, description, due date and alert date.  
The user can edit the task, delete it or mark it as done in the overview.  

#### There are two different modals that can pop up

- Add/Edit task (depending on the state)
- User settings

#### Notifications

There are notification popups in the bottom right corner for warnings or reminders. They disappear after a short time or can be closed with the button.
